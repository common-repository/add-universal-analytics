************************************************

This plug-in is for those who want an easy way to add the Google Universal Analytics tracking code to their website without editing the source code. If you already have an Analytics account, all you will need to do is activate this plugin and enter your tracking ID and domain.

Note: You will need to have Universal Analytics enabled for your website (do this in the Analytics control panel), otherwise this plugin will not work. Read the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2817075?hl=en">official instructions</a>.

== How to use ==

Note: You will need to have Universal Analytics enabled for your website (do this in the Analytics control panel), otherwise this plugin will not work. Read the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2817075?hl=en">official instructions</a>.

After activating the plugin, go to the Wordpress Settings page, scroll down and look for the 'Analytics Tracking ID' and 'Domain' fields (they will have red borders for easy spotting). Simply fill in the fields with your Tracking ID (get that from your Google Analytics control panel) and Domain and hit 'Save Changes'.

Don't use http://www. in your domain name or a trailing slash. Just keep it domain.com

Note that the universal analytics tracking code will not appear in your website source code while you are logged in as an administrator. This is so your own activity on the website isn't contributed to your stats.
